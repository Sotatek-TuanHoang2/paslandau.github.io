In this tutorial I'll show my typical procedure when setting up an new development environment on a fresh Windows 10 laptop.
It's not like I do this every day (as 'typical' might suggest) but when I started my current job, I had to do it 
several times for me (switched my laptop) as well as for some of my co-workers. I'm going to cover this step-by-step
and will include (hopefully) all necessary information for you to get this setup running as well. 

Let's get to it, shall we?
