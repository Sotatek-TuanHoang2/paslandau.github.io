<p>Greetings, dear stranger of the internet. Please take a seat and make yourself at home. To shorten your waiting time, you
might enjoy a little reading over at the <a href="/blog">blog</a> or the <a href="/bigquery-snippets">BigQuery snippets</a>.
    That is, if you're interested in coding/software development, working out or simply in what I have to write.</p>
<p>In case we never met and you have no idea who you're dealing with, thou shalt start at the <a href="/about">about moi</a> page.</p>
