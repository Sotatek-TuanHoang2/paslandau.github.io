I'm a 30 year old tech enthusiast who currently works as Head of Marketing Technology, Webtracking and SEO 
at <a href="http://corporate.aboutyou.de/en/">ABOUT YOU GmbH</a>.
At this particular point in time, I'm really digging software development especially backend PHP coding particularly with 
Laravel. Oh, and Gooogle BigQuery (lots of love <3) Apart from that I've always enjoyed earning money on the internet - which initially brought me to SEO. Which 
was a lot more fun when Google was not that sophisticated tbh :) Besides that, I tend to work out.

There are same basic philosophies and ground rules I've found particularly useful (this list will grow, give it some time:P):

> give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime

I've always enjoyed teaching things. Simply put: I love learning new stuff myself and I am grateful for living in
a time when almost every piece of information one can possibly dream of is out there. 
When figuring out a particular problem myself, there was often that feeling of "if only I had known 'x' four hours ago ..."
and I'd like to spare other people that experience.
On the other it gets better with every problem you solve because, well, most problems boil down to asking the right questions aka. 
googling the right stuff (which is one of the most valuable skills a developer has to master, imho).

I feel very strongly about not simply presenting the solution but explain the way you got there. Chances are, you'll
encounter a similar problem at some point in the future and I would rather give you the necessary tools to figure it
out yourself than solving it for you _again_.

> I can't manage what I can't measure.

> One accurate measurement is worth a thousand expert opinions.

These are _big_ ones. If you're coming from a mindset of "always learning", you'll embrace the philosophy of
"The more I know about X, the more I know that I don' t know X" at some point. You'll start to 
constantly question your work (and that of others...) because you are used to the fact, that there seldom
is one truth and the more you get to know about a topic, 
the more likely it is that you'll have to change your opinion on something.

Combine that with highly complex fields and black box components (think AI, Attribution Modeling, Re-engineering 
Google's ranking algorithm) and you'll quickly notice, that there are perfectly reasonable assumptions that
are still completely incorrect. It does not matter how you feel about something or 
how much you think you are an "expert". Unless proven, that really does not count much. 
I'm not saying there is no value in an experts opinion, especially if the one having it has a lot of 
experience in the field at hand - that's still super valuable in terms of developing a hypothesis. 

But in the end, numbers and metrics are your one, true friend. 

> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure

As a software engineer, you're probably familiar with "the cost of a bug":

![Cost of a bug in software development](/img/cost-of-a-bug.png "Cost of a bug in software development")

After realizing that, the phrase "... but we didn't have time to write tests!" becomes almost comical.
Making errors is human. Things break, that is absolutely normal. But isn't it so much better to see
that _immediately_ instead of "crossing-fingers and hoping that nothing breaks - and if so that no one notices"?
