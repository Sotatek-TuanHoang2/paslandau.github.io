I'm a 28 year old tech enthusiast who currently works as a tech lead at [ABOUT YOU GmbH](http://corporate.aboutyou.de/en/).
At this particular point in time, I'm really digging software development especially backend PHP coding particularly with 
Laravel. Apart from that I've always enjoyed earning money on the internet - which initially brought me to SEO. Which 
was a lot more fun when Google was not that sophisticated tbh :) Besides that, I tend to work out.

There are same basic philosophies and ground rules I've found particularly useful (yes, this list will grow 
when one of them comes up :P):

> give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime

I've always enjoyed teaching things. Simply put: I love learning new things myself and I am grateful for living in
a time where there's basically every piece of information out there one can possibly dream of. That being said, I've 
also experienced _huge_ differences when figuring out a particular problem myself and in the end there was almost 
always that feeling of "if only I had known 'x' four hours ago ...". But it gets better with every problem you solve 
because, well, most problems boil down to asking the right questions aka. googling the right stuff (which is one of
the most valuable skills a developer has to master, imho).

I feel very strongly about not simply presenting the solution but explain the way you got there. Chances are, you'll
encounter a similar problem at some point in the future and I would rather give you the necessary tools to figure it
out yourself than solving it for you _again_.
